3.  **Save the File:** Save the file as `README.md`.  **Important:** Make sure to save it with the `.md` extension.  In some text editors, you might need to select "All Files" as the file type to prevent the editor from adding a `.txt` extension.

That's it! You now have a `README.md` file that you can place in the root directory of your project. Then, follow the icon instructions from my previous message.
